Stream-Hiker
============

StreamHiker – an ANS-developed model for evaluating environmental conditions (e.g. land use/land cover, subsurface, climate) along a stream or river reach and associated drainage area, at multiple spatial scales (e.g. reach, network) – is used by the modeling team for: 

  • Developing and evaluating accuracy of techniques for extrapolating watershed model estimates of water quality   
      parameters at the reach scale 
      
  • Developing and evaluating high resolution watershed-scale models of various levels of complexity (statistical models of varying spatial complexity, with and without network routing, and with some deterministic elements).  
  
  • Investigating how BMPs affect surface water quality (i.e. temperature) and ecological well-being (i.e. fish growth potential), developing models to predict performance and optimize placement of BMPs to achieve indicator targets, and quantifying uncertainty of predictions.
